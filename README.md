Network Defense 

Objective: 

Defend the network from various attacks from a penetration tester increasing in difficulty

This network defense lab displays me defending the lab from penetration testing from an auditor. The attacks start simple with hashing but get more and more complicated and difficult going further up the attackers toolkit. The more complicated the attacks get and higher up the pyramid of pain the more likely they are to pivot to a less difficult target.

Skills Learned:

Network defense tactics

malware sandboxing and analysis

hashing & blocking hash

firewall rules & management

DNS & DNS management

Registry modification & defense 

networking rules & options

log analysis
